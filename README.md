Using Z test because sample size is greater than 40. xbar = 230km/hr, mu0 = 260km/hr, standard dev = 10km/hr and sample size is 100. z= (xbar-mu0)/(standard dev/sqrt(sample size)) = -30
The value of z is greater than the standard value hence we will reject the null hypothesis. Indian roads do not affect the top speed.
